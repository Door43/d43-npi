  * **धेरै समय देखी संसारमा मानिषहरू बसी रहन्थे । उनीहरू धेरै दुष्ट र नराम्रा भएका थिए। यो धेरै नराम्रो हुनाले परमेश्वरले ठूलो जल-प्रलय को व्दारा संसारलाई नष्ट गर्ने निर्णय गर्नूभयो।**

But Noah found favor with God. He was a righteous man, living among wicked people. God told Noah about the flood He was planning to send. He told Noah to build a huge boat.

God told Noah to make the boat about 140 meters long, 23 meters wide, and 13.5 meters high. Noah was to build it with wood and to make three levels, many rooms, a roof, and a window. The boat would keep Noah, his family, and every kind of land animal safe during the flood.

Noah obeyed God. He and his three sons built the boat just the way God had told them. It took many years to build the boat, because it was so big. Noah warned the people about the flood that was coming and told them to turn to God, but they did not believe him.

God also commanded Noah and his family to gather enough food for themselves and the animals. When everything was ready, God told Noah it was time for him, his wife, his three sons, and their wives to get into the boat—eight people in all.
